# Parameter-optimization-of-a-technical-indicator-with-a-genetic-algorithm-in-the-Mexican-stock-exchan

May 2021

This work focuses on the use of a genetic algorithm to optimize the selection of parameters for a technical indicator, Relative Strength Index (RSI) and it’s effectiveness to increment the profits of a trading strategy using it’s parameters. This study found that using a genetic algorithm to optimize parameters yielded a 57% annual profit, versus a 6% annual profit gained just by using the default parameters.

Python libraries used:
- fastquant
- math
- numpy
- random
- matplotlib
